## Problem Description

> Multiple trucks are trying to cross a **single bridge** in order.
> The bridge can hold at most **`bridge_length` trucks** at the same time,
> and cannot exceed its **maximum weight capacity (`weight`)**.
> Trucks move forward by one unit every second.

**Goal:** Calculate the total time required for all trucks to cross the bridge.

## Approach

- Model the bridge as a `deque` with a fixed length (`bridge_length`).
- Each element in the deque represents either:
  - A truck's weight (if present), or
  - `0` (if empty)
- **Every second**:
  1. Remove the first element using `popleft()` (a truck leaves the bridge).
  2. Update the total weight on the bridge (`cw`).
  3. If the next truck can be added without exceeding the weight limit, add it; otherwise, append `0`.
- Loop ends when the bridge is empty and all waiting trucks have crossed.


## Code

```python
from collections import deque
from typing import List

def solution(bridge_length: int, weight: int, truck_weights: List[int]):
    bridge = deque([0] * bridge_length, maxlen=bridge_length)
    truck = deque(truck_weights)
    answer = 0
    cw = 0  # current weight on the bridge


    while cw != 0 or truck:
        answer += 1
        cw -= bridge.popleft()

        if not truck:
            bridge.append(0)
            continue

        next_truck = 0
        if cw + truck[0] <= weight:
            next_truck = truck.popleft()
            cw += next_truck

        bridge.append(next_truck)

    return answer
```

## Thoughts

- Modeling the bridge with a queue was an effective and intutive approach.
